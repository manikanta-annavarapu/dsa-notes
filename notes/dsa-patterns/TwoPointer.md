# Two Pointer Pattern

A two pointer pattern indicates that we use two pointer at the same time to navigate through the array/string and try to solve the problem.

This pattern is mostly applicable to strings or arrays.

Some versions of two pointer pattern are

- First point at the start of the array and second pointer at the end of array.
- If the result suppose to be an array using two point sometime we may need to fill the resultant array from start or from the end.
- In some cases, sorting an array will help us navigate the array in an organized manner.
